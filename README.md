We wanted to build a platform for everyone to connect on multiple mediums (Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, Twitter, YouTube, Github, LinkedIn, etc) in an immediate and intuitive way, instead of the slow normal way of adding a person to each social media one by one. (Note: We are not a new social media platform)

Over the course of the hackathon we were able to build a website that connects your Facebook, Instagram, Github, Snapchat, and Phone number to anyone else in a second by scanning a QR code.

To improve it beyond the hackathon we see two major objectives. The first is to add every popular platform available to Add.me. This opens up the opportunity of having multiple profiles per user. For instance, a profile for friends containing Snapchat, Facebook, Twitter, Periscope, and Instagram accounts and a separate profile for work containing Github, LinkedIn, and Medium. This could be extremely disruptive not only for making friends and networking, but also for brands converting sales.

Our second objective would be to optimize our platform for brands. In today's market, companies like Nike beg for a consumer's continuous attention. In fact, they pay billions of dollars per year for it. Superbowl advertisements are just one example of how much of an investment a company will pay in order to get our attention. Social media marketing has quickly become the best option for brands due to the cost of entry (free) and the massive amount of attention placed by consumers. Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and Snapchat advertisements remain some of the most underpriced and underrated channels of marketing in today's world.

Add.me can get involved in this marketplace by offering consumers a one click way of following all of a brands' content everywhere that both the brand is and the consumer wants to be. For example, I love soccer. I will spend hours a day watching soccer highlights. By pressing one button, I could follow all of Nike Soccer's channels on Youtube, Snapchat, Instagram, and Facebook. Not only do I gain value from all of Nike Soccer's content, but Nike Soccer gains brand equity and customer loyalty, for free. For absolutely free.
